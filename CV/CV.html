        <p>Review paper,
Bombay Technologist, ICT, Mumbai.
We as a team of 3 have published a review paper named, ‚ÄúReview on biofuel production from agricultural waste in a sustainable way: Pathways, Processes and Technological advances.‚Äù , in the 71st edition of The Bombay Technologists Journal, 2024. The review focuses on the sustainable ways of the production of biofuels from the agricultural waste. The study examines the current technologies, advancements and global impacts of converting agricultural wastes to biofuels like biodiesel, bioethanol and biogas. It explores pretreatment methods, conversion pathways (Biological, and chemical and thermochemical) and future outlook of the conversion methods for biofuel production. 
The key objective of the review is to assess potential of agricultural waste to address energy demand for future while reducing the environmental impact.  This review aims to provide valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and industries involved in renewable energy and sustainable development.</p>

    <h2>Internships</h2>
      <h3>Acmegrade Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai</h3>
         <h4>Finance</h4>
         <p>I have completed a 3-months Finance internship under Acmegrade Pvt. Ltd. In the internship we were first trained for a few initial days for the work we had to do later under the internship. As finance interns we were expected to study and comment on the financial status of different companies based on the given data. The lessons learned during the internship has added to my money management skills and time management abilities.
At the end of the internship, we were given a project where we had to crack a case study of a company from the point of view of the owner and stake holder of the company. Each intern was assigned a different company and he/she had to make use of the balance sheet of the given company to comment on its financial position. It was a quite interesting and helpful project which required a thorough understanding of the financial terms and their applications. </p>
